### 1.  Hello World!

Here's an R code chunk that prints the text 'Hello world!'.

```{r}
print("Hello world!")
```

### 2. Loading data

For this example we'll use a very simple dataset.  The `cars` data comes with the default installation of R.  To see the first few columns of the data, just type `head(cars)`.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

.... Note: this is **not** a good plot. What is it? What's the headline? 
Let's try again. 

```{r}
plot(cars, 
     main="Here's the title of the plot",
     xlab="I changed the x label :)")
```
