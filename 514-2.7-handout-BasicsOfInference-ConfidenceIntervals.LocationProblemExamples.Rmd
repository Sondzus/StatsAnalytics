#  Some well-known confidence intervals

## Theoretical constructs 
During the lecture, we will go over confidence intervals for means, differences in means, by hand.
Includes small examples.

# Estimating population mean --  Application: Ames housing: R

```{r, include=TRUE}
ames <- make_ames()
```

```{r}
sampl <- ames %>%
  sample_n(size = 50) 
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = sampl, aes(x = Gr_Liv_Area)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100)
```

# What is the mean area of a home sold in Ames, IA? 

> Question: 
What statistics are we supposed to use?
  What is its sampling distribution?


```{r}
housing.area.t <- t.test(sampl$Gr_Liv_Area)
#ignore all output for now except the confidence interval 
#(because it is NOT meaninguful!)
housing.area.t 
```
---

Compare: 
```{r}
t.test(sampl$Gr_Liv_Area,conf.level = .98)
```


# Estimating difference in means between two populations 

##  Application: Birhtweight: R

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
birthwt <- as_tibble(MASS::birthwt)

# Rename variables
birthwt <- birthwt %>%
  rename(birthwt.below.2500 = low, 
         mother.age = age,
         mother.weight = lwt,
         mother.smokes = smoke,
         previous.prem.labor = ptl,
         hypertension = ht,
         uterine.irr = ui,
         physician.visits = ftv,
         birthwt.grams = bwt)

# Change factor level names
birthwt <- birthwt %>%
  mutate(race = recode_factor(race, `1` = "white", `2` = "black", `3` = "other")) %>%
  mutate_at(c("mother.smokes", "hypertension", "uterine.irr", "birthwt.below.2500"),
            ~ recode_factor(.x, `0` = "no", `1` = "yes"))
```

* Recall the data set: 
```{r, size = 'tiny'}
birthwt <- as_tibble(birthwt)
birthwt
```


##  Difference in means
Create boxplot showing how birthwt.grams varies between
 smoking status: 
 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
qplot(x = mother.smokes, y = birthwt.grams,
      geom = "boxplot", data = birthwt,
      xlab = "Mother smokes", 
      ylab = "Birthweight (grams)",
      fill = I("lightblue"))
```

This plot suggests that smoking is associated with lower birth weight.

---

**How can we assess whether this difference is statistically significant?**

Let’s compute a summary table

```{r}
birthwt %>%
  group_by(mother.smokes) %>%
  summarize(mean.birthwt = round(mean(birthwt.grams), 0),
            sd.birthwt = round(sd(birthwt.grams), 0))
```

---

> Question:
What statistics are we supposed to use?
  What is its sampling distribution?


 
Therefore, we should use commands that involve `t`,  
such as `t.test`:
 
```{r}
birthwt.t.test <- t.test(birthwt.grams ~ mother.smokes, 
                         data = birthwt)
birthwt.t.test
```

We see from this output that the difference is highly significant. The t.test() function also outputs a confidence interval for us.

--- 

Notice that the function returns a lot of information, and we can access this information element by element: 
```{r}
names(birthwt.t.test)
birthwt.t.test$estimate  # group means
birthwt.t.test$conf.int  # confidence interval for difference
```



# >> Markdown tricks! << 

The ability to pull specific information from the output of the hypothesis test allows you to report your results using inline code chunks. That is, you don’t have to hardcode estimates, p-values, confidence intervals, etc.

```{r} 
# Calculate difference in means between smoking and nonsmoking groups
birthwt.t.test$estimate
birthwt.smoke.diff <- 
  round(birthwt.t.test$estimate[1] 
        - birthwt.t.test$estimate[2], 1)
# Confidence level as a %
conf.level <- 
  attr(birthwt.t.test$conf.int, "conf.level") * 100
conf.level
```

--- 

Example: Here’s what happens when we knit the following paragraph.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
Our study finds that birth weights are on average 
`r birthwt.smoke.diff`g higher in the non-smoking group 
compared to the smoking group 
(t-statistic `r round(birthwt.t.test$statistic,2)`, 
  p=`r round(birthwt.t.test$p.value, 3)`,
  `r conf.level`% CI [`r round(birthwt.t.test$conf.int,1)`]g)
```
**Output:**

Our study finds that birth weights are on average `r birthwt.smoke.diff`g higher in the non-smoking group compared to the smoking group (t-statistic `r round(birthwt.t.test$statistic,2)`, p=`r round(birthwt.t.test$p.value, 3)`, `r conf.level`% CI [`r round(birthwt.t.test$conf.int,1)`]g)

# Extras
There are nicer ways (that are not the basic thing we're using so far) to plot and visulaize t-test and its outputs. For a nice reference, see [this page](https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/how-to-do-a-t-test-in-r-calculation-and-reporting/). 

# Application: Python

Scipy.Stats t!
The `t` class have similar behavior like `t.test` in R, for constructing a mean sample t-test you can modify the parameters: 
`df`(degree of freedom), `mean`(sample mean), `sd`(sample standard error) and `Confidence_level`, and then use the following command:


`confidence_interval = scipy.stats.t.interval(Confidence_level, df, mean, sd)`. 

For 2 sample t-test, you can use the following function (remember that you can change the confidence level as your desired value in the function):

# All kinds of t-tests...^[Neat summary from https://www.statmethods.net/stats/ttest.html]

### There are several scenarios that can happen when there are two populations! 

The `t.test( )` function in `R` produces a variety of t-tests. Unlike most statistical packages, the default assumes unequal variances... here is the scoop:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# independent 2-group t-test
t.test(y~x) # where y is numeric and x is a binary factor
# independent 2-group t-test
t.test(y1,y2) # where y1 and y2 are numeric
# paired t-test
t.test(y1,y2,paired=TRUE) # where y1 & y2 are numeric
# one sample t-test
t.test(y,mu=3) # Ho: mu=3
```

You can use the var.equal = TRUE option to specify equal variances and a pooled variance estimate. You can use the alternative="less" or alternative="greater" option to specify a one tailed test.

# Wait. What are these 'tests' to which we are referring?! 

Next, let's introduce a formal statistical procedure called a **hypothesis test**!
