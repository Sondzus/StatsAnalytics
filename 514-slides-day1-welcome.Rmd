# First lectures & expectations 

* You will learn a little bit  about me
* I  will learn a little bit about you
* We will go over some of the course logistics
  * The course  syllabus website has **a lot more** information than I can cover in a few minutes.
  * What we will go over is **an overview**. 
  * The rest is your "homework" to read and discover. 

\pause 
Let's get started!

# Roadmap 

* Lectures: \attn{Zoom} [as you know, since you are here!] 
  * Be prepared to open a browser or your smart phone or other device to 
  
  \attn{AhaSlides.com/STATITMWn} $\leftarrow$ note link changes weekly to $n=$ current week number.
* Everything else: \attn{Campuswire} 
  * links to lecture video (speaker&screen view only)
  * PDFs of notes written during lecture 
  * any slides shared
  * any handouts for reacing
  * HW links for download & submission. These will take you to \attn{Google Classroom}. You need to add this course on Google classroom.
  * Questions, information, discussion, peer Q&A, etc. 

#### The tech:

* We will be using R code and Python code. 
* You will learn to type Markdown documents.
* This will be required submission format for all work.



#  Lecture  time: 

The majority of the lecture  was done via AhaSlides and iPad screen share in the live lecture. Curren students will receive the video recording. 

* \attn{Statistical reasoning with data}
* \attn{Role of probability, role of chance}
* A short overview of what R/Rstudio look like (next slides) 



# Why R?

- Free (open-source)

- Programming language (not point-and-click)

- Excellent graphics

- Offers broadest range of statistical tools

- Easy to generate reproducible reports

- Easy to integrate with other tools



# The R Console

Basic interaction with R is through typing in the **console**

This is the **terminal** or **command-line** interface

```{r, out.height = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rterminal.png")
```



# The R Console & RStudio & Python (together)
- You type in commands, R gives back answers (or errors)

- Menus and other graphical interfaces are extras built on top of the console

- We will use **RStudio** in this class

1. Download R: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html

2. Then download RStudio: http://www.rstudio.com/

3. Install Python (if you dont' already have it): https://www.anaconda.com/


# RStudio is an IDE for R

RStudio has 4 main windows ('panes'):

- Source
- Console 
- Workspace/History
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help

# RStudio is an IDE for R

<div style="float: left; width: 30%;">
RStudio has 4 main windows (aka 'panes'):

- Source
- Console 
- Workspace/History
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 65%;">
```{r, out.height = "500px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rstudio_panes.png")
```
</div>

# RStudio: Panes overview

1. __Source__ pane: create a file that you can save and run later

2. __Console__ pane: type or paste in commands to get output from R

3. __Workspace/History__ pane: see a list of variables or previous commands

4.  __Files/Plots/Packages/Help__ pane: see plots, help pages, and other items in this window.

# Console pane

<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">
- Use the **Console** pane to type or paste commands to get output from R

- To look up the help file for a function or data set, type `?function` into the Console
  - E.g.,  try typing in `?mean`
  
- Use the `tab` key to auto-complete function and object names
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 55%;">
```{r, out.height = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/pane_console.png")
```
</div>


# Source pane

<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">
- Use the **Source** pane to create and edit R and Rmd files

- The menu bar of this pane contains handy shortcuts for sending code to the **Console** for evaluation
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 55%;">
```{r, out.height = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/pane_source.png")
```
</div>



# Files/Plots/Packages/Help pane

<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">
- By default, any figures you produce in R will be displayed in the **Plots** tab 
  - Menu bar allows you to Zoom, Export, and Navigate back to older plots
  
- When you request a help file (e.g., `?mean`), the documentation will appear in the **Help** tab
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 55%;">
```{r, out.height = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/pane_plots.png")
```
</div>


# RStudio: Source and Console panes

```{r, out.height = "500px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rstudio.png")
```



# RStudio: Toolbar

```{r, out.height = "500px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/menus.png")
```


# R Markdown
- R Markdown allows the user to integrate R code into a report

- When data changes or code changes, so does the report

- No more need to copy-and-paste graphics, tables, or numbers

- Creates __reproducible__ reports
  - Anyone who has your R Markdown (.Rmd) file and input data can re-run your analysis and get the exact same results (tables, figures, summaries)
  
- Can output report in HTML (default), Microsoft Word, or PDF

# R Markdown

<div style="float: left; width: 30%;">
- This example shows an **R Markdown** (.Rmd) file opened in the Source pane of RStudio.  
- To turn an Rmd file into a report, click the **Knit HTML** button in the Source pane menu bar
- The results will appear in a **Preview window**, as shown on the right
- You can knit into html (default), MS Word, and pdf format
- These lecture slides are also created in RStudio (using beamer_presentation as the output format, which is not what you typically will use) 
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 65%;">
```{r, out.height = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rmarkdown1.png")
```
</div>


# R Markdown

<div style="float: left; width: 30%;">
- To integrate R output into your report, you need to use R code chunks

- All of the code that appears in between the "triple back-ticks" gets executed when you Knit
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 65%;">
```{r, out.height = "500px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rmarkdown2.png")
```
</div>
