# Background 

> What is the purpose of these notes? 

1. Provide a few small examples of functions in R; 
2. Provide html/Markdown with several lines of `R` code you can use to practice writing functions. 




# Context 

How are we using R?

* Code is modular, nothing is "from scratch"
* **Functions** are the basic building block of what we do. 
 


#  Functions
- We have used a lot of built-in functions: `mean()`, `subset()`, `plot()`, `read.table()`...

- An important part of programming and data analysis is to write custom functions

- Functions help make code **modular**

- Functions make debugging easier

- Remember: this entire class is about applying *functions* to *data*

# What is a function?

> A \attn{function} is a machine that turns **input objects** (arguments) into an **output object** (return value) according to a definite rule.

- Let's look at a really simple function

```{r}
addOne <- function(x) {
  x + 1
}
```

- `x` is the **argument** or **input**

- The function **output** is the input `x` incremented by 1

```{r}
addOne(12)
```

# More interesting example

- Here's a function that returns a % given a numerator, denominator, and desired number of decimal values

```{r}
calculatePercentage <- function(x, y, d) {
  decimal <- x / y# Calculate decimal value
  round(100 * decimal, d) # Convert to % and round to d digits
}

calculatePercentage(27, 80, 1)
```

- If you're calculating several %'s for your report, you should use this kind of function instead of repeatedly copying and pasting code

# Function returning a list
- Here's a function that takes a person's full name (FirstName LastName), weight in lb and height in inches and converts it into a list with the person's first name, person's last name, weight in kg, height in m, and BMI.
\small
```{r}
createPatientRecord <- function(full.name, weight, height) {
  name.list <- strsplit(full.name, split=" ")[[1]]
  first.name <- name.list[1]
  last.name <- name.list[2]
  weight.in.kg <- weight / 2.2
  height.in.m <- height * 0.0254
  bmi <- weight.in.kg / (height.in.m ^ 2)
  list(first.name=first.name, last.name=last.name, 
       weight=weight.in.kg, height=height.in.m,
       bmi=bmi)
}
```
 \normalsize 
 
# Trying out the function
```{r}
createPatientRecord("Michael Smith", 185, 12 * 6 + 1)
```

# Another example: 3 number summary
- Calculate mean, median and standard deviation
```{r}
threeNumberSummary <- function(x) {
  c(mean=mean(x), median=median(x), sd=sd(x))
}
x <- rnorm(100, mean=5, sd=2) # Vector of 100 normals 
                              # with mean 5 and sd 2
threeNumberSummary(x)
```


# If-else statements

- Oftentimes we want our code to have different effects depending on the features of the input

- Example: Calculating a student's letter grade
  - If grade >= 90, assign A
  - Otherwise, if grade >= 80, assign B
  - Otherwise, if grade >= 70, assign C
  - In all other cases, assign F

- To code this up, we use if-else statements

# If-else Example: Letter grades
\small 
```{r}
calculateLetterGrade <- function(x) {
  if(x >= 90) {
    grade <- "A"
  } else if(x >= 80) {
    grade <- "B"
  } else if(x >= 70) {
    grade <- "C"
  } else {
    grade <- "F"
  }
  grade
}

course.grades <- c(92, 78, 87, 91, 62)
sapply(course.grades, FUN=calculateLetterGrade)
```

# `return()`

- In the previous examples we specified the output simply by writing the output variable as the last line of the function

- More explicitly, we can use the `return()` function

```{r}
addOne <- function(x) {
  return(x + 1)
}

addOne(12)
```

- We will generally avoid the `return()` function, but you can use it if necessary or if it makes writing a particular function easier.
- Google's style guide suggests explicit returns.  Most do not.
