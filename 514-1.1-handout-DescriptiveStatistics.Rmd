# Background 

> What is the purpose of these notes? 

1. Provide a few small examples of descriptive statistics;
2. See bar plots, histograms, boxplots;
3. Frequency distribution - visualization. 

> What is the format of this document?

*(One more time, I will add these notes.)*  
This document  was created using `R Markdown`. You can read more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and check out a [cheat sheet here](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf), which will guide you through installing RStudio, and from there the moment you create  a new `.Rmd` document, it will be a  working template to start from.  If you are used to using `LaTeX`, no worries: it can be embedded into `Markdown`, with overall simpler formatting. I hope you find this useful! 

# Loading required packages

To run some of the commands below, you need to load `qqplot2`: 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

# Example of a small data set
In R, the letter "c" stands for "column" and is used to create a data vector (column vector) of numbers. Think of it as an ordered list, simply. 

## Example from a book on car battery data
Note that we can manually enter data, in a list, and store it under the name  `car.batteries`. (Of course this is *not* how you'll be loading the data in practice!)
```{r carbatteries}
car.batteries<-c(
  2.2,4.1,3.5, 4.5, 3.2, 3.7, 3.0, 2.6, 3.4, 1.6, 3.1, 3.3, 3.8, 3.1, 4.7, 3.7, 2.5, 
  4.3, 3.4, 3.6, 2.9, 3.3, 3.9, 3.1, 3.3, 3.1, 3.7, 4.4, 3.2, 4.1, 1.9, 3.4, 4.7, 
  3.8, 3.2, 2.6, 3.9, 3.0, 4.2, 3.5
)
```
Let's plot the histogram of the above! 
```{r fig.width=5}
hist(car.batteries)
hist(car.batteries,freq=FALSE)
hist(car.batteries,freq=FALSE,ylim = c(0,1),xlim=c(1,6),main = paste("Histogram of..."),col="blue")
lines(density(car.batteries),col="red") # estimated distribution 
```

Note that we can change the options... study the code. Note the figure width can be controlled, as well as the limits on the x and y axes, the main title, and the color. 

# Using descriptive statistics to classify 'shape of data'

As n grows, the histograms may change. 
Here are examples of various normal distributions (you don't need to know what that _really_ means yet). 
```{r descriptivestats}
# set sample size so the code below can be re-run by just changing this quantity: 
sample.size = 100
```
 
 What descriptive statistics would you use to summarize this kind of data? 
```{r descriptivestats.cont}
par(mfrow = c(1,3)) # aligns figures in a grid! in this case, a 1x3 grid. 
# sample the data: 
x <- rnorm(n=sample.size)
y <- rnorm(n=sample.size,mean=250,sd=300)
z <- rnorm(n=sample.size,mean=10,sd=1)
# plot the histograms: 
hist(x)
hist(y)
hist(z)
```

Let us introduce the "five-number summary" + mean: 
```{r fivenumsummary}
summary(x)
summary(y)
summary(z)
```

What happens when we change the sample size to $n=1000$ and re-run the same commands as above? 
```{r rerundescriptive, echo=FALSE}
sample.size = 1000
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
x <- rnorm(n=sample.size)
hist(x)
y <- rnorm(n=sample.size,mean=250,sd=300)
hist(y)
z <- rnorm(n=sample.size,mean=10,sd=1)
hist(z)
```

Let us visualize the quantile summaries of a  simple data set:
```{r quantile.visualization}
my.data<-x
fivenum(my.data)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
boxplot(my.data)
boxplot(my.data)
abline(h = min(my.data), col = "Blue")
abline(h = max(my.data), col = "Yellow")
abline(h = median(my.data), col = "Green")
abline(h = quantile(my.data, c(0.25, 0.75)), col = "Red")
```
In the code above, the third line par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) creates a grid of size 1x2 for plots; it divides the plot area into a grid so you see several plots on the same page as opposed to separately. Try changing the 1 and the 2 to something else!
