**Post-lecture update** 

Here is the full set of slides, in format of a handout, where you can see **all** of the code you need to run the examples: 
[514-2.7-handout-BasicsOfInference-ConfidenceIntervals.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Sondzus/StatsAnalytics/blob/master/514-2.7-handout-BasicsOfInference-ConfidenceIntervals.html)

------  

**in-lecture update** : 

The lecture example cannot be run without this code first, which is *not* shown in the slides: 
 
```{r}
# library("dplyr")  # need f or using sample_n  function below.
sampl <- ames %>%
  sample_n(size = 50) 
``` 
This is like going into the City Assessorâ€™s database and pulling up the files on 50 random home sales. Working with these 50 files would be considerably simpler than working with all 2930 home sales.

# Sampling distribution of `area`

```{r}
# library("ggplot2")
ggplot(data = sampl, aes(x = Gr_Liv_Area)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100)
```


* What's your best guess, based only on this single sample, of an estimate of the average living area of houses sold in Ames? 

# Point estimators (we won't use much)

* What's your best guess, based only on this single sample, of an estimate of the average living area of houses sold in Ames? 
  - $\overline{X}$ sample mean, or sample median: 
```{r}
sampl<-as_tibble(sampl)
mean(sampl$Gr_Liv_Area)
median(sampl$Gr_Liv_Area)
```
> this is called a **point estimator**. 

# Interlude: which point estimator is 'better'? 

```{r, include=FALSE}
sample_means100 <- rep(NA, 5000)
sample_medians100 <- rep(NA, 5000)
for(i in 1:5000){
  samp <- sample(area, 100)
  sample_means100[i] <- mean(samp)
  sample_medians100[i] <- median(samp)
}
```
```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.height=3}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

hist(sample_means100, breaks = 20, xlim = range(sample_means100), main="5000 sample means")
hist(sample_medians100, breaks = 20, xlim = range(sample_medians100), main="5000 sample medians")
```

```{r sampleMeansVsMedian}
# mean of sample mean:  (!)
mean(sample_means100)
# mean of sample median: 
mean(sample_medians100)
# population mean: 
mean(area)
```
# Effect of sample size, revisited

```{r, include=FALSE}
sample_means10 <- rep(NA, 5000)
sample_means50 <- rep(NA, 5000)
sample_means100 <- rep(NA, 5000)

for(i in 1:5000){
  samp <- sample(area, 10)
  sample_means10[i] <- mean(samp)
  samp <- sample(area, 50)
  sample_means50[i] <- mean(samp)
  samp <- sample(area, 100)
  sample_means100[i] <- mean(samp)
}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(3, 1))
xlimits <- range(sample_means10)
hist(sample_means10, breaks = 20, xlim = xlimits, main="5000 sample means of samples of size 10")
hist(sample_means50, breaks = 20, xlim = xlimits, main="5000 sample means of samples of size 50")
hist(sample_means100, breaks = 20, xlim = xlimits, main="5000 sample means of samples of size 100")
```
