# Background 

> What is the purpose of these notes? 

1. Overview of Markdown at a high level.  
  * Note: Lab 1 worksheet ("HW0") is  actually a really good place to start, and it gives you a template to work with. All HW assignments will be done the  same way - you will be given a Markdown file  in which you are to write your code *and* your  explanations.

#  What to  do?  

## Markdown

* Markdown is a simple way of formatting text and data analyses. Refer to [lecture week 1](https://campuswire.com/c/G961E3137/feed/9) $\leftarrow$Campuswire link.
* You will use RStudio to embed R code in Markdown as well as Python code (via the `reticulate` package). Refer to [additional resources week 1](https://campuswire.com/c/G961E3137/feed/10) to view TA's video on how the Python setup will work. 

## First you need  to install and load packages

Just like every other programming language you may be familiar with, R's capabilities can be greatly extended by installing additional "packages" and "libraries".

To **install** a package, use the `install.packages()` command.  Here is an example: 

```
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

You only need to install packages once.  Once they're installed, you may use them by **loading** the libraries using the `library()` command.  For today's lab, you'll want to run the following code

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # graphics library
```

## Code chunks 

Code is written in 'chunks'. Text  is written as plain text, and it can be formatted  in various ways. 
You should check out the first link above, which will give you a comprehensive overview. 

#  Expectations & deliverable requirements

Professionalism is  what we  will strive for.

* File formats that you submit must follow course requirements, as  stated  in homework instructions.  
  * The moment you submit something other  than .Rmd, .html, .pdf, your homework will be returned  to you without grade.  
* Code your write needs to  be clean and clear. Add comments when  necessary to explain what each line or function is doing.
* Leftover  instructions: 
  * Points will be deducted  for any text that  says "insert  code  here" or "your answer here" in your homework submission.
* Clarity  of exposition:
  * Write clearly. Explain precisely. English sentences need to have correct grammar, and each sentence needs to have a purpose. 
  * Do not write things like "see above code; output is the answer". 
  * Use of inline code chunks is  required insetad  of copying&pasting results of a computation. This is so  that if you re-do the data analysis with new data, the entire document should be updated automatically.
  * Write your homework and reports as if  you are turning them into your clients at work. 
    * Can everyone understand the purpose? 
    * Is it clear what is your conclusion?
    * Are all the graphics appropriately labeled?
    * etc. 


# Appendix

> The rest of this document was from an R template that was placed here by default when I created a new R-markdown document! I find it useful. 


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
