# Exploratory data analysis^[https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html]

* Use visualisation and transformation to explore your data in a systematic way. EDA is an iterative cycle. You:
  - Generate questions about your data.
  - Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and modelling your data.
  - Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.

* *Not* a formal process with a strict set of rules;  "a state of mind."

*  EDA is an important part of any data analysis, even if the questions are handed to you on a platter, because you always need to investigate the quality of your data. Data cleaning is just one application of EDA: you ask questions about whether your data meets your expectations or not. To do data cleaning, you’ll need to deploy all the tools of EDA: 
    - visualisation, 
    - transformation, and 
    - modelling.


# Questions
> “There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable statistical routines.” — Sir David Cox 

## Goal:  
develop an understanding of your data. 


* EDA is fundamentally a creative process: the key to asking *quality* questions is to generate a large *quantity* of questions. 
* There isn't one rule, but here is a guideline:
  - What type of variation occurs within my variables?
  - What type of covariation occurs between my variables?

* Concepts to remember: variable, value, observation, tabular data. 


# Variation

Recall: 

> Variation is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement.

To understand, we try to visualize distributions. 

* Bar  charts (type of random variable: \pause discrete/categorical)
* Histograms (type of random variable: \pause continuous)

## Visualizations
We have talked a lot about histograms and sampling distributions and have applied them to small data sets. Let's go through a larger running example and see some nicer visualizations. 


# Wrangling data

# What is 'wrangling'? 
From <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html>: 

> In this part of the online book, you’ll learn about data wrangling, the art of getting your data into R in a useful form for visualisation and modelling. Data wrangling is very important: without it you can’t work with your own data! There are three main parts to data wrangling:
